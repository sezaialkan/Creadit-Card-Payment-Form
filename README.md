## Setup

After making sure that gulp and npm are installed on the device, we need to install the npm packages in the directory.

```javascript
npm install
```
After the package installations, it is sufficient to enter the `gulp serve` code into the terminal in the directory.

```javascript
gulp serve
```
After running the project, there will be a compiled output under the `dist` folder. If you want to access the raw codes, you can browse the `public` directory.
